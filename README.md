## **🛍️ Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering**
**📌 Problem Statement**

Retail stores often have large customer bases with varied purchasing behaviors. This project aims to use K-Means Clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to group customers into distinct segments based on their purchase history and spending patterns. These insights can help businesses develop targeted marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

**📁 Dataset Description**

The dataset used is Mall_Customers.csv, which contains the following fields:
CustomerID – Unique ID for each customer
Gender – Male or Female
Age – Age of the customer
Annual Income (k$) – Customer's income in thousands
Spending Score (1-100) – A score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature
This dataset helps in identifying customer clusters with similar characteristics based on income and spending scores.

**🧠 Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to analyze the customer data using K-Means Clustering to discover distinct customer groups. These clusters are formed by identifying patterns and similarities in their annual income and spending habits.
Through this unsupervised learning approach, we aim to:
Understand different types of customers (e.g., high-income high-spending, low-income low-spending)
Visualize the clusters using appropriate plots
Help businesses personalize services and offers for each segment
